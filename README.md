<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
After completing my CompTIA A+ and Google IT Support certifications, I wanted to take the next step: applying that knowledge in a practical setting to better prepare for a job in the industry. So I challenged myself to build a home lab environment from scratch and itâ€™s been a great experience!

Using VirtualBox, I set up a small network running Active Directory on Windows Server. From there, I went deeper:

-Configured DHCP scopes and leases to automate IP address assignment across the virtual network <br/>
-Created and managed 1,000 users in Active Directory to simulate a real-world organization structure<br/>
-Practiced user and group policies, DNS setup, and troubleshooting within the lab environment

This project helped me reinforce key IT concepts and get hands-on experience with:

Windows Server & Active Directory administration <br/>
Networking and IP management <br/>
Identity and access control at scale <br/>
Planning and executing IT infrastructure setups <br/>

<br />


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>
